                <p class="lead mb-4">
                    With over 10 years of experience in software development, I've worked on diverse projects 
                    ranging from healthcare systems to government applications. My journey has taken me from 
                    Bolivia to Russia and the Netherlands, giving me a global perspective on software development.

                    I specialize in building scalable applications using modern technologies and best practices. 
                    My experience includes working with microservices architecture, cloud platforms, and leading 
                    development teams to deliver high-quality solutions.
